# A Very Foxy LD48
A group of ragtag super developers born of Malf's chat take LD48 by storm.

Just testing commiting changes.

## Technicalities
* The project uses Unity 2021.1.3f. You can install it via [Unity Hub](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download), and if it's unavailable there due to a newer version coming out, you can find it in the [Unity download archive](https://unity3d.com/get-unity/download/archive).
* The render pipeline currently used is URP, but can be changed if necessary.
